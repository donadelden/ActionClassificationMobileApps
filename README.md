## App identification through encrypted network traffic monitoring

Project of Digital Forensics course

Abstract: With the spreading of modern smartphones, users have started to use a huge number of different applications. Modern software employ cryptography systems in order to prevent eavesdropping of the communications. Sometimes, to enforce privacy, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is exploited inside smartphones in order to masquerade addresses in the network flows.  
In this work we demonstrate that, based only on the length of transmitted and received packets, it is possible to infer what application has generated the traffic, creating a breach on the privacy of the user. 
Some different Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been applied showing scores higher than 96% using the more advanced models, however maintaining reasonable training times.
